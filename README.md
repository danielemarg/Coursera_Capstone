# Predicting Land Prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina

This project contains multiple parts:

1. A description of the problem and a discussion of the background (Week 1)

2. A description of the data, source of the data, and how it will be used to solve the problem (Week 1)

Methodology and Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 2)

Inferential statistical testing (Week 2)

Discussion and conclusion section. Observations and recommendations based on the results (Week 2)

## 1. Introduction and Discussion of the Business Objective and Problem

### The Task At Hand
A Real Estate Agent, with a substantial e-commerce expertise in temporary apartments rent management, decided to diversify his business operations opening a new business branch of land sales to investors to build studio apartments. As a part of his strategy he has decided to be more informed and selective, and take the time to do some market research.
I've been given the task of assisting him to make data-driven decision. This will be a major part of his decision-making process, the other being focused on the ground qualitative analysis.
Since the temporary apartment rental market in Buenos Airs is expanding greatly, real estate investors seek to invest by building housing units that maximize their utility, the studio apartments. 
This project is part of a full data science and machine learning studio using other techniques, such as clustering, classification and recommendation systems. 
As requested, the main goals in this step of the project are: 
-	Identify the most expensive neighborhoods through data analysis and visualization tools.
-	Build a regression model for predicting land prices in Buenos Aires.
-	Improve our model by adding data through the Foursquare API, defining a function to search number of venues near a piece of land. 

## 2. The Data Science Workflow

The Data Science Workflow includes the following:

•	**Outline the initial data that is required:**

To develop the project we need data regarding the neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, the surface in square meters and land prices per square meters in USD. We require to research the data and to identifify a suitable useable source. If it is found but is not in a useable form, data wrangling and cleaning will have to be performed.
The  Foursquare data to build the multi-linear regression model exploring the number of venues near a piece of land is readily available. 

•	**Obtain the Data:**

Research and find suitable sources.
Access and explore the data to determine if it can be manipulated for our purposes.

•	**Initial Data Wrangling and Cleaning:**

Clean the data and convert to a useable form as a dataframe.

•	**Data Analysis and Location Data:**

Devolop a simple linear to predict the land prices.
Foursquare location data will be leveraged to explore the number of venues near a piece of land to improve our model. Build a multi-linear regression model.

•	**Visualization:**

Analysis and plotting visualizations.
Data visualization using various mapping libraries.

•	**Discussion and Conclusions:**

Recomendations and results based on the data analysis.
Discussion of any limitations and how the results can be used, and any conclusions that can be drawn.
